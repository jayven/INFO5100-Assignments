Q1 Explain the difference between final and finally in Java 8.

Final is a keyword, it is used to apply restriction on class, method and variable. Variable value with final keyword
cannot be changed after they initialized. Final class can't be inherited and final method can't be overridden in the
child classes

Finally is a block and also a keyword, it is used to place important code, and it will be executed even if an exception
is handled. It will executed after a try/catch block.
